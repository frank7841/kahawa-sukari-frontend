                      About PMC
                    </h2>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
                      The Pontifical Missionary Childhood (PMC) was founded in
                      1843 by Bishop Charles de Forbin Hanson in France. Our
                      motto is "Children Helping Children" - we are little
                      flowers of Jesus, helping other children, especially the
                      less fortunate. PMC's role in the Church is to save
                      children's lives from death and misery, to give others
                      hope in God and in life, and prepare them to be apostles
                      to their fellow children.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
                      PMC welcomes children within the age bracket of 0-14
                      years. As Jesus said, "let the little children come to me"
                      - and so we follow Him courageously and joyfully. Jesus
                      becomes our intimate friend in various ways, especially
                      through the Rosary prayer, for He says, "where two or
                      three are gathered I am in their midst."

                        such as respect, patience, helping the needy, visiting
